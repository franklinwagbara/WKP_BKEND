If you can’t type anything in the Windows 10 search bar, please try two of these methods:
Method 1:
Right click on the start menu or press Windows + X keys on the keyboard, select and open Command prompt (admin).
Then enter the below commands and hit Enter key:
Command 1: 
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
Now enter the below command and hit Enter key: 
Command 2: 
 
Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}

If the issue still persist, follow the second method:
Method 2:
Open the Task manager by pressing CTRL+Shift+ESC keys. Or you can open it by right clicking on the taskbar if it works.
Then click File an then Run New Task. Make sure you have a check mark beside “Create this task with administrative privileges”. Now type Powershell. 
Type the following in the Powershell prompt:

$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest 

Wait till the process completed and then close the Powershell window. Now, reboot the computer and check if it helps.
